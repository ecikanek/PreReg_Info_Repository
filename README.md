# Pre-Registration Repository

This repository was made in part because of the pre-registration kerfuffle on Twitter in January 2021 when the Journal of Politics (https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/journals/jop/instruct) changed their submission guidelines for experiments. Since the JOP lists a number of possible pre-registration options, I wanted to try and collect as many as possible in one place for the sake of comparison and to perhaps make switching to pre-registration for experiments a little less daunting. 

However, because it makes sense that the researcher constraints from pre-registration are not just for experimenters but for everyone, I have included templates and documentation for a variety of types of research. 

The repository contains templates from a number of pre-registration websites. While I will try to keep the documents up to date, the best I can guarantee is cross-checking things once a quarter (but perhaps less - I should be writing).

As of January 19, 2021 the repository contains documents from: 

* [OSF](https://osf.io/zab38/)

* [AsPredicted.org](https://aspredicted.org)

* [EGAP](https://egap.org/registry/)


I am planning on adding templates from: 

* [AEA RCT](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/site/instructions)



If there are other templates of interest, please feel free to [email me](ecikanek@umich.edu) or comment on the repository. 

Since this is in the initial stages (as of January 19, 2021) I am still working on the organization and structure of this repository. Therefore below is short-term To Do list: 


## To-Do
* Organize each organization's folder. 
* Update READMEs with additional organizational information and observations about the files. 
* Add material to folder with general pre-registration resources/links. 

If there are other things you think you could like to see here, you can let me know. Even better, you can contribute to this GitHub! When you do, please add  your name to the list of contributors below:
