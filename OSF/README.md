# OSF Templates

1) The remplates in this repository are from the the OSF webpage "Templates of OSF Registration Forms" found here: https://osf.io/zab38/
    a) The template for the 2016 ANES data competition is not included nor are the fMRI templates
    
2) While this repository will try to stay up to date, it is unlikely that I will be able to check more than once a quarter, though I invite you to comment if there is something I missed or to send me an email. 

3) The OSF Templates include a template for AsPredicted.org, which I have put in a separate repository since it has a separate website from OSF.
